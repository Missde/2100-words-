Every summer, I stay focused on learning science and history, and I also study technology that helps protect the environment. Some subjects are difficult, but my mom always encourages me to keep going. I turn these challenges into motivation, and later I'll use what I've learned to build a better future. Every small step now will bring great changes-this journey teaches me to cherish the present and chase dreams bravely."}
