In every class, our teacher uses good examples to teach us values. I have a close friend; we talk about our dreams once a week, go to the park together, and join the same club. There we learn and have fun. I remember my dad told me to always be sure of myself. ¡°Yes,¡± I replied. The exact thing I love most is sharing happy moments with friends. I hope we keep this friendship and make every day meaningful again and again."}
