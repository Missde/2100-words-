Please protect every river in our city-don't throw rubbish without thinking. We should pay attention to saving energy, like turning off lights when leaving. Sometimes we feel tired and want to sleep, but free time can be used to help others.\nWinter may be cold, but a warm heart can move everyone. Don't mean to ignore small things—bad habits can be changed soon. With the right information, we'll probably make wiser choices. Keep an open mind, do what we can, and our world will grow more beautiful."}
