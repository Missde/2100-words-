Usually, I listen to music online, but today I care more about picking a good present.\nA kind woman in the bookstore helped me. She recommended a book¡ªits cover tells a nice story, and there's a piece of paper with a warm paragraph inside. I paid the money, and the shop gave a small discount off the price.\nThe girl at the counter said my dad would really like it. I hope this same love lets him know: though he still works hard every day, he's always in my heart."}
