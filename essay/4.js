After class, I get my food and take it to eat with friends. We also go out to play. \nToday is very special - it's my first time winning a prize! I'm happy because my old dream has come true. \nWhich part do I like most? The time when we walk into the classroom and start a new day. Now, I know school is the best place for me."}
