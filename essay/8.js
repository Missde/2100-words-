It was even more interesting than I thought!\nSome classmates shared art works, and others told short stories. I brought tea and talked about its history. We had a lot of space to show ourselves, and no one felt down. The teacher said it's important to keep practicing¡ªwe should never be afraid to speak.\nWhen class came to an end, we said ¡°Merry Christmas!¡± to each other. Here, every word we learn helps us grow. I'll keep this happy memory and never look back on my fear of speaking English."}
