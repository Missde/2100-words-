We added some milk and mixed all the things up. The cake was very good.\nAfter that, I called my friend. I asked, “Would you like to come over, or stay at home?” He came over soon. We played many games. After there had been a long time of fun, he asked, “What time is it?” I looked at the clock—our time has flown by! Before he left, I gave them (him and my mom) some cake. I like our short happy day so much."}
